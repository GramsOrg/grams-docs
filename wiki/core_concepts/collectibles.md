## Collectibles

Grams Collectibles is a decentralized application that allows you to create, own, and trade unique digital assets. Each asset, or collectible, is represented as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the blockchain. These tokens cannot be exchanged for other tokens on a one-to-one basis because each token is unique and has its own value. The following are core concepts that you should understand to use the Grams Collectibles platform.

## Collectibles Smart Contracts

Grams Collectibles uses smart contracts to create, manage, and exchange collectibles. These smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on the blockchain and enforce the rules of the platform. They ensure that each collectible is unique, that ownership is clearly defined, and that transactions are secure and transparent.

## Creating Collectibles

To create a collectible, you need to create a smart contract that defines the properties of the token. The smart contract will define the name, symbol, and other characteristics of the token, as well as any custom properties that you want to include. Once the smart contract is created, you can use it to mint new tokens.

## Owning Collectibles

Each collectible is represented as an NFT, which means that it has a unique identifier that cannot be replicated or duplicated. When you own a collectible, you are the only person who can transfer it to someone else. The smart contract that governs the collectible keeps track of ownership and ensures that ownership is transferred securely.

## Trading Collectibles

To trade collectibles, you can use a marketplace or exchange that is built on top of the Grams Collectibles platform. These marketplaces allow you to list your collectibles for sale, and other users can buy them using the cryptocurrency supported by the platform. The marketplace handles the transaction and ensures that ownership of the collectible is transferred securely.

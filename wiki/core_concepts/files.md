## Files

The Grams platform enables decentralized file storage using IPFS, with the ability to store and access files directly from a web browser. This allows developers to build decentralized applications with seamless access to user files, while users can maintain control over their data and file sharing.

### Features

The Grams platform provides several features for managing files, including:

-   Uploading files to IPFS from the browser
-   Downloading files from IPFS to the browser
-   Creating and managing directories in IPFS
-   Adding and removing files from directories
-   Encrypting files and directories
-   Sharing files and directories with other users

### Architecture

The Grams platform stores files in IPFS, a decentralized storage protocol that enables peer-to-peer file sharing. IPFS uses content-addressing, which means that files are addressed based on their content, rather than their location. This ensures that files are accessible from any node in the network, and that they can be updated without changing their location.

### Usage

Developers can use the Grams SDK to integrate file storage and management into their decentralized applications. The SDK provides a simple interface for uploading, downloading, and managing files and directories in IPFS.

### Browser Extension

The Grams browser extension provides a convenient way for users to interact with their files on the Grams platform. The extension allows users to upload and download files directly from the browser, as well as manage their files and directories.

### Security

The Grams platform prioritizes security, and files are stored using encryption to ensure that they are only accessible by their owners. Files can also be shared securely between users using end-to-end encryption.

### Conclusion

The Grams platform provides a powerful solution for decentralized file storage and management, with features such as content-addressing, encryption, and NFT integration. Developers can use the SDK to build decentralized applications that leverage these features, while users can maintain control over their data and file sharing.

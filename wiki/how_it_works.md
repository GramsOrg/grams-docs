## How it Works

Grams is a fast, secure, and feeless cryptocurrency built on top of the IOTA Tangle platform and IPFS. Grams is designed to provide a fast and efficient way to send and receive transactions while maintaining a high level of security and privacy.

## The IOTA Tangle Platform

The IOTA Tangle platform is a distributed ledger technology that enables feeless and fast transactions. Unlike traditional blockchain platforms, which use miners to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain, the IOTA Tangle platform uses a unique consensus algorithm called the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

In the IOTA Tangle platform, every transaction confirms two previous transactions, creating a web of transactions that are all interconnected. This approach eliminates the need for miners, making transactions faster and more efficient.

## IPFS

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a distributed file storage system that allows users to store and access files in a decentralized way. IPFS stores files in a content-addressed way, which means that files are identified by their content rather than their location. This approach makes it easy to access and share files, even if the original location is offline.

The Grams Developer Guide is a comprehensive resource for developers who want to build applications and tools that integrate with the Grams cryptocurrency and ecosystem. This knowledge base provides in-depth documentation, tutorials, and examples for building on top of the Grams platform, including the IOTA Tangle and IPFS.

The Grams Developer Guide is designed to be a practical resource for developers of all skill levels. Whether you're an experienced developer looking to build on a new platform, or a novice developer looking to get started with cryptocurrency development, this knowledge base has everything you need to get started.

## Features

Grams is built with security and privacy in mind, so you can trust that your users' data is safe and protected. Here are some of the features you can expect from the Grams Developer Guide:

-   **User-owned data**: Users own and control their own data, and all data is encrypted and stored securely.
-   **Fast and scalable**: Grams is built on the IOTA Tangle platform, which means you can expect fast and feeless transactions, even during high traffic.
-   **Cross-platform support**: Grams has SDKs for Node.js, Android, Swift, and Unity3D, making it easy for you to integrate Grams into your existing projects.
-   **Interoperability**: Grams can be used in conjunction with other blockchain technologies, enabling cross-chain communication and interoperability.

## Security

Security is a top priority for the Grams ecosystem. We use a range of measures to ensure that your data and transactions are secure, including:

-   **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, using state-of-the-art encryption protocols.
-   **Decentralization**: Grams is built on the IOTA Tangle, a decentralized distributed ledger technology that ensures that your data and transactions are not controlled by a single point of failure.
-   **Trustless**: The Grams ecosystem is trustless, meaning that users do not need to rely on third parties to verify transactions or provide security.

In the rest of this guide, we will provide you with more technical details on how to use the Grams SDKs and APIs to build your decentralized applications.

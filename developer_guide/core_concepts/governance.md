## Governance

Grams Governance is an abstract module that provides a unified interface for creating, managing, and voting on proposals, which can be used for various use cases. This module is built on top of the IOTA Tangle, utilizing its distributed ledger and secure hashing capabilities to ensure the integrity and immutability of proposals and their associated data.

### Proposals

A proposal is a request for a specific action or decision to be taken by the network. A proposal can be created by any user with a Grams account, and can be submitted for consideration by the community. Proposals can cover a wide range of topics, from technical changes to the protocol to community governance and marketing initiatives.

Each proposal has a unique identifier, and contains the following information:

-   Title: A short and descriptive title for the proposal.
-   Description: A detailed description of the proposal and its goals.
-   Budget: The amount of funds requested (if applicable) to carry out the proposal.
-   Start and end dates: The timeframe for the proposal to be considered and voted on.

### Voting

Once a proposal is created, it can be voted on by members of the community. Users can vote for or against a proposal, or choose to abstain. The voting process is designed to be fair and transparent, with each user's vote being recorded on the IOTA Tangle and counted towards the final tally.

### Funding

If a proposal is approved by the community, the requested funds (if applicable) will be automatically transferred to the proposal creator's account. This ensures that approved proposals can be executed in a timely and efficient manner.

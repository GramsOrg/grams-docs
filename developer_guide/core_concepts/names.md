## Names

Names are a core concept in the Grams ecosystem that allow users to create and own unique identifiers on the network. Each name is represented as a non-fungible token (NFT) that can be accessed and controlled using the Grams browser extension.

## Creating a Name

To create a name, users can access the Grams browser extension and select the "Create Name" option. This will prompt the user to enter a name for their identifier, as well as any associated metadata they wish to add to the NFT. The name will then be minted on the network as a new NFT that is owned by the user.

## Managing Names

Once a name has been created, users can access it through the Grams browser extension and manage its attributes, state, and behavior. Attributes can include metadata such as description, image, and other identifying information, while state refers to the current state of the NFT, such as whether it is transferable or locked. Behavior refers to any associated smart contract functionality that can be programmed into the NFT.

## Accessing Names

Names can be accessed and controlled using the Grams browser extension, which provides a user-friendly interface for managing NFTs on the network. Additionally, names can be accessed using the Grams SDK, which allows developers to interact with the network and perform actions such as creating and managing NFTs programmatically.

## Grams Name Service

The Grams Name Service (GNS) is a decentralized naming system that allows users to map human-readable names to blockchain addresses. GNS enables users to use user-friendly, easy-to-remember names instead of long, hard-to-remember addresses. GNS names are accessible using the "grams://" deep link format, similar to the "https://" protocol used for accessing websites.

## Hosting and Deployment

To host a web application using a Grams name, users can create a JSON file that specifies the IPFS hash of their application and the associated name. This file can be uploaded to IPFS and accessed using the Grams browser extension, which will resolve the name to the associated IPFS hash and load the application in the user's browser.

## Conclusion

Names are a powerful feature of the Grams ecosystem that allow users to create and control unique identifiers on the network. By leveraging the Grams browser extension and SDK, users can easily create, manage, and access NFTs and use the Grams Name Service to map user-friendly names to blockchain addresses. The hosting and deployment process is simple and allows users to quickly and easily share their web applications with the world.
